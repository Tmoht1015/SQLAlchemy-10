# SQLAlchemy-10
All code was created using tools and code from class activities
Turned to ChatGPT for 'from datetime import datetime' to remedy my issues with the last two routes outputting the exact same values. If someone could explain what I did wrong in my feedback and actually where points were lost (this was not done on challenge 9, please specify where points are lost in the future). I will more than likely be giving another go at this because my notebook's code seemed fine! Go easy on me! I also would like to note that other classmates and I found the directions quite vague and this should be considered in the grading seeing as how the data in the notebook is distinctly different than what is asked to output in the API routes. Like previous assignments, the correct outputs should be there for every cell that requires one so we know we're doing the assignment correctly!
